Falls are a significant concern for the elderly population, often leading to serious injuries and a decrease in the quality of life. Detecting falls promptly can enable quick assistance, potentially reducing the severity of injuries and providing peace of mind for both seniors and their families. In my recent project, I set out to create a highly accurate, real-time fall detection device that minimizes false positives while operating on a resource-constrained platform.
