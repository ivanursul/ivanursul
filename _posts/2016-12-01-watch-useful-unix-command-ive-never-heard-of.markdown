I use ImageMagick for resizing images in one of the projects, and I needed a command to monitor folder changes in a temporary folder. So I found [watch](https://linux.die.net/man/1/watch):

```
watch -d -n 0.3 'ls -l | grep ivanursul'
```

This command check every **0.3** seconds for current folder, and find all files, created by user **ivanursul**
