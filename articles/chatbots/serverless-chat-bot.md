### <a href="#list-interface" name="list-interface"><i class="fa fa-link anchor" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> List Interface

Welcome to the blog about List Interface. In this article, I am going to introduce a concept of List and its implementations such as Vector and Stack with the accent to the ArrayList and LinkedList. I hope you will enjoy the content and gain some new experience.

The Java List Interface represents a collection of elements. What is characteristic about List is that same element can occur more than once, also elements in a List have an insertion order and they can be iterated in that order.
